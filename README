ABOUT MAILMAN-MILTER

mailman-milter is a milter for Postfix or Sendmail that checks Mailman
posting rules for incoming mailing list posts. Messages that would be
rejected or discared by Mailman are instead rejected by the milter at
SMTP time. This reduces backscatter, since it's not necessary to accept
the message just to have Mailman bounce it.

CURRENT STATUS

mailman-milter is pre-release software with no documentation. I have
released the source code in case it's useful to someone else, but I
can't guarantee I'll develop or support it at all.
