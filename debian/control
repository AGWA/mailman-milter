Description: Milter for checking Mailman posting rules
 mailman-milter is a milter for Postfix or Sendmail that checks Mailman
 posting rules for incoming mailing list posts. Messages that would be
 rejected or discarded by Mailman are rejected by the milter at SMTP
 time. This reduces backscatter, since it's not necessary to accept the
 message just to have Mailman bounce it.
